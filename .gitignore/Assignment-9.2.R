#2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of
#California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a
#40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from
#1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
#officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
# Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.

#test statistic is not less than -2.32, so it does not fall into the critical region. Therefore,
